/* Continuous vs. categorical variables
In order to choose an appropriate type of plot to draw, you need to be able to distinguish between continuous variables (roughly: "things you can do arithmetic on") and categorical variables (roughly: "things that can be classified"). 

State which of these variables are continuous and which are categorical.

/* Classy classification! The distinction between continuous variables (numbers) and categorical variables (text) is important when deciding what kind of plot to draw. */
