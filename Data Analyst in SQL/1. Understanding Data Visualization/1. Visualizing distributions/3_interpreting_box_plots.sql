/* ### **Interpreting box plots**

Here are box plots of cigarette consumption per person in the USA from 1985 to 1995 (Alaska and Hawaii are not included). Each observation in the dataset is the average number of packets of cigarette smoked per person in one state in one year. Thus each box plot represents the distribution of 48 data points (because there are 48 US states included in the dataset).

--Beautiful box plots! Although each box plot contains less information than a histogram, because they are so compact to draw, it is easy to compare many distributions at once.
