### **Interpreting correlation heatmaps**

If you want to find the relationship between many pairs of numeric variables, you can use a close relative of the pair plot, namely the *correlation heatmap*. It takes the correlation scores you saw from the pair plot, but rather than giving you lots of numbers to look at, it displays them using colors. A great use case for this is finding related products.

Here's a dataset from a survey on scotch whisky consumption. In the correlation heatmap, each row and column shows a brand of scotch, and cells show that correlation between drinking one brand and drinking another within the past twelve months.

**Instructions**

Categorize these statements about the correlation heatmap as true or false.

—Sláinte! Correlation heatmaps are a great way to visualize the correlation between many continuous variables at once.
