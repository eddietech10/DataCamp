### **Highlighting data**

Up to now we've focused on using color and other plot aesthetics to make all data points stand out as much as others. Usually that's a good idea, but occasionally you'll want to highlight specific data points.

Here's the dataset of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time, from Chapter 2. Songs by two rappers at the center of the 1990s East Coast-West Coast hip-hop Rivalry, The Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac, are colored differently.

Use the sliders to control the highlighting of songs by these artists via point size, transparency, and chroma.

How many songs for each artist made it onto the critics' list?
