### **Interpreting pair plots**

To get a quick overview of a dataset, it's really helpful to draw a plot of the distribution of each variable, and the relationship between each pair of variables. A *pair plot* displays all these plots together in a matrix of panels. It shows a lot of information at once, so to interpret it, try looking at one panel at a time.

Here you can see the Panamanian camera trap data for the agouti and paca, as well as three new species: coati, brocket, and peccary.

—Perfect pairing! Pair plots are fantastic for getting quick insight into several variables at once.
