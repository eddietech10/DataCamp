### **Another dimension for scatter plots**

If you have a scatter plot, but want to distinguish the points in some way based on another variable, then you have a few options. As discussed in the video, 3D plots are usually dreadful on a 2D screen, but there are other options to stick to x-y axes and still visualize the third dimension. You can change the color, size, transparency or shape of the points, or split the plot into multiple panels.

Here you can see the dataset of house prices in Los Angeles county, USA, that you first encountered in Chapter 2.

Explore different options for distinguishing points from the four cities, then determine which statement is false.

**Instructions**

- [ ]  Using different sizes or transparencies makes it hard to distinguish points that overlap.
- [ ]  Using separate panels provides the best way to distinguish points from each city, but makes it harder to see if there is a single trend across the whole dataset.
- [x]  Using different shapes provides the best way to distinguish points from each city, but makes it harder to see if there is a single trend across the whole dataset.
- [ ]  Using different color provides a good way to distinguish points from each city, but lighter colors can be hard to see against a white background.

â€”Distinguished point distinguishing! There are several different ways of distinguishing points in a scatter plot, but color and separate panels are the most reliable methods, unless you want to spend hours squinting at the plot.
