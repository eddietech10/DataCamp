### **Qualitative, sequential, diverging**

There are three types of color scale, each designed to highlight different things in a visualization.

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| qualitative | Distinguish unordered categories |
| sequential | Show ordering |
| diverging | Show above or below a midpoint |

Here you can see the results of a survey about math anxiety from a class of students. Each question has its own row, and responses range from "Strongly Disagree" to "Neutral" to "Strongly Agree".

Choose an appropriate color scale for the plot.

—Divine use of a diverging scale! A diverging scale is appropriate here since the responses have a natural midpoint of “Neutral”.
