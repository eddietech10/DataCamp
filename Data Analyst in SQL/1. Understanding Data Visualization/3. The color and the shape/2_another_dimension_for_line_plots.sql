 ### ****Another dimension for line plots****

As with points in a scatter plot, you may often want to be able to distinguish several lines in a line plot. Like points, you can change the colors or transparency level, or use multiple panels. The two differences to points are that you can change line widths rather than point sizes, and you can change linetype (solid, dashes, or dots) rather than point shape.

The line plot shows the stock price for five technology companies collectively known as "FAAMG": Facebook (`FB`), Apple (`AAPL`), Amazon (`AMZN`), Microsoft (`MSFT`), and Google (`GOOG`). The prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits, then scaled to be relative to their highest price over the time period so they are more easily comparable.

Explore different options for distinguishing lines from the five companies, then determine which statement is false.

**Instructions**

- [ ]  All five companies began 2018 with a higher price than they began 2017.
- [ ]  In 2018, Facebook's stock price decreased by a greater fraction than any of the other companies.
- [ ]  From the start of 2019 to the start of 2020, Apple's stock price more than doubled.
- [x]  All five companies began 2020 with a higher price than they had half way through 2019.

—Your line plot skills are limitless! Amazon's stock price decreased in the second half of 2019. Similar to the case of scatter plots, the best choices for distinguishing lines are often colors or separate panels.
