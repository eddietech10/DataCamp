### **Interpreting parallel coordinates plots**

Parallel coordinates plots are designed to help you view the relationship between many continuous variables at once.

Here is a dataset of fatty acid levels in olive oils samples from six regions in Italy. Each line in the plot represents one oil sample. Since the region is a categorical variable, you have six parallel coordinates plots, one in each panel.
