### **Bar plot axes**

When we look at a bar plot, we use the relative lengths of each bar to help interpret what is happening. If you don't include zero on the axis used for bar lengths, then the relative lengths of bars are distorted, and it is easy to be misled.

Here is a bar plot of another question from the Health Survey for England, this time about people with asthma. ("Not asthmatic" means no asthma symptoms were reported, and no medication was taken for asthma in the previous 12 months.)

Compare version of the plot with each y-axis, and determine which statement is true.

**Instructions**

- [x]  The percentage of asthmatics is less than 15% for every age group.
- [ ]  16-24 years olds have more than twice the percentage of non-asthmatics than 45-54 year olds.
- [ ]  The majority of people aged 35-74 are asthmatic.
- [ ]  The percentage of asthmatics ranges from about 40% to about 80%, depending upon the age group.

â€” Bad-ass bar plot axis interpretation! When zero is not included in the y-axis, you have to really stare at the axis labels to know what is happening, and it is easy to be misled.
