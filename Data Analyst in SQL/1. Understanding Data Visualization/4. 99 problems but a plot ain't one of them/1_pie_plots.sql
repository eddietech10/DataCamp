### **Pie plots**

*Pie plots* (sometimes called pie charts) are extremely popular, but often difficult to interpret. They are just bar plots converted into polar coordinates, and humans are generally worse at perceiving angles accurately compared to lengths.

Following on from the scotch whisky dataset in the last chapter, here's another dataset from the Health Survey for England, this time on alcohol consumption in English men aged 16 or more. Pie segments and bar heights represent percentages of responders.

Look at the pie plot and the bar plot and determine which statement is true.

**Instructions**

- [ ]  Only the 75+ age group had more non-drinkers than people drinking 14 to 35 units per week.
- [ ]  Three age groups had more than 30% of people drinking 14 to 35 units per week.
- [ ]  All age groups had less than 20% non-drinkers.
- [x]  All age groups had at least 50% of people drinking up to 14 units per week.

— Delightful drinking plot interpretation! Polar coordinates are usually a bad idea. A bar plot is almost alway easier to interpret than a pie plot.
