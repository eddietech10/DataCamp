### **Trends with scatter plots**

Adding trend lines to a scatter plot can make it easier to articulate the relationship between the two variables.

Here you can see the life expectancy for each country again, this time plotted against the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (a measure of how rich the country is). You have a choice between linear and logarithmic scales on the x-axis, and can add linear or curved trend lines.

Which statement best describes the trend?

**Instructions**

- [ ]  Life expectancy increases linearly with GNI when GNI is between $1k and $50k.
- [x]  Life expectancy increases linearly with the logarithm of GNI when GNI is between $1k and $50k.
- [ ]  Life expectancy decreases when GNI increases above $50k.
- [ ]  Life expectancy increases when GNI decreases below $500.

â€” Terrific trend line usage! By comparing the linear and LOESS curved trend lines you can easily see when the data is increasing faster or slower than linearly, which can help you describe the relationship between the variables.
