### **Line plots without dates on the x-axis**

Although dates and times are the most common type of variable for the x-axis in line plot, other types of variable are possible.

In the video, you saw data on the ages of juvenile offenders in Switzerland. That data was presented with time on the x-axis and one line for each age. Since that plot wasn't very satisfactory, we'll try again. This time, age is on the x-axis and there is one line for each year. In the plot you can see two separate clusters of lines representing different age profiles for the offenders.

Which year did the change in age profile of juvenile offenders take place?

—A mature solution to visualizing juvenile offenders! Line plots don't need time on the x-axis; numbers work just as well.
