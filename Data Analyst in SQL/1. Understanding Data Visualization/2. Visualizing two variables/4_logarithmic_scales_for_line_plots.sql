### **Logarithmic scales for line plots**

If you have a dataset where the values span several orders of magnitude, it can be easier to view them on a logarithmic scale.

A subset of the COVID-19 coronavirus data is shown in the line plot. You saw in the video that most of the cases in early 2020 occurred in mainland China. You might wonder what is happening in the rest of the world. Here, the six countries with the most number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China are shown.

On the **linear** scale, notice that moving up one grid line in the plot **adds** 20000. On the **logarithmic** scale, moving up one grid line in the plot **multiplies** by 4.

Considering the six countries on the plot, which statement is true?

**Instructions**

- [ ]  On Feb 3, excluding mainland China, US had the most cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.
- [ ]  On Feb 17, Germany had more cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 than France.
- [ ]  On Mar 02, Iran had less than 1000 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.
- [ ]  On Mar 16, US had less than 4000 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.

— Lovely line plot interpreting! If your data spans many orders of magnitude, choosing a logarithmic y-axis can make it easier to distinguish between the lines.
