/* ### **Interpreting line plots**

Line plots are excellent for comparing two continuous variables, where consecutive observations are connected somehow. A common type of line plot is to have dates or times on the x-axis, and a numeric quantity on the y-axis. In this case, "consecutive observations" means values on successive dates, like today and tomorrow. By drawing multiple lines on the same plot, you can compare values.

The following line plot shows the percentage of households in the United States that adopted each of four technologies (automobiles, refrigerators, stoves, and vacuums) from 1930 to 1970.

**Instructions**

Categorize these statements about the line plot as true or false.

### **Hint**

- Start by reading the legend so you know which colors correspond to which technologies.
- To answer questions about what happened on a particular date, find that date on the x-axis, then look up until you hit the lines of interest.
- To answer questions about comparing adoptions after a particular date, follow the lines to see if they cross.

— Terrific tech adoption analysis! Line plots are especially good at letting you answer questions about continuous values over time.
