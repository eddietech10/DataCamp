â€”Badass bar plot interpretation! Although USA had the most famous athletes by country, and soccer had the most famous athletes by sport, there were no famous soccer players from the USA. By looking at both categories at once, you saw that the most common categories for famous athletes were basketball and football players in the USA, and soccer players in Germany and Brazil.
