Hue and scatter plots:

In the prior video, we learned how hue allows us to easily make subgroups within Seaborn plots. Let's try it out by exploring data from students in secondary school. We have a lot of information about each student like their age, where they live, their study habits and their extracurricular activities.

For now, we'll look at the relationship between the number of absences they have in school and their final grade in the course, segmented by where the student lives (rural vs. urban area).

Create a scatter plot with "absences" on the x-axis and final grade ("G3") on the y-axis using the DataFrame student_data. Color the plot points based on "location" (urban vs. rural).

# Import Matplotlib and Seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Change the legend order in the scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x="absences", y="G3", 
                data=student_data, 
                hue="location")

# Show plot
plt.show()

Make "Rural" appear before "Urban" in the plot legend.
