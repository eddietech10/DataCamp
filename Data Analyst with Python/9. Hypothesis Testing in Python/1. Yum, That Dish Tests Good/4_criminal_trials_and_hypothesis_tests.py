Possible Answers:

Just as with criminal trials, there are more than two possible results at the conclusion of a hypothesis test.

=> Just as the defendant is initially assumed not guilty, the null hypothesis is first assumed to be true.

The defendant can be both guilty and not guilty for the crime charged, and both the null and alternative hypotheses can be chosen at the end of the test.

Just as a court can decline to give a verdict, it's possible for neither the null hypothesis nor the alternative hypothesis to be chosen at the end of the test.

Just as the defendant is initially assumed guilty, the alternative hypothesis is first assumed to be true.

I pronounce you not guilty! It's sometimes helpful to think of your hypothesis test as being a trial of the statistic.
